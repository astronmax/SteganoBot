# SteganoBot
## Bot for hiding information in images
This is a bot in social network [VK](https://vk.com/).

Using buttons in direct messages with this bot, you can opperate with various tools to **encode** and **decode** the desired text in png format image.

The project is under development,so in the future it is planned to release processing with:
* GIF image format 
* BMP
* RAW

Moreover, there is also an idea to add an ability of encoding and decoding information in audio-format files, such as 
* WAV 
* AIFF

To start the program in local regime and test it, you can run **<format_name>_local_test.py** file, for example png_local_test.py.

It is planned to work on an ongoing basis on web server [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), so VK users could use this bot whenever they want.
